<s> If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same. </s>
<s> Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  </s>
<s> Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened! </s>
<s> How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie! </s>
<s> The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me </s>
<s> Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing! </s>
<s> The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you! </s>
<s> The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out! </s>
<s> The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well! </s>
<s> Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook! </s>
<s> Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out </s>
<s> If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild </s>
<s> The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN! </s>
<s> I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left! </s>
<s> Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.) </s>
<s> Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD! </s>
<s> There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end! </s>
<s> An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates. </s>
<s> Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite! </s>
<s> Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else! </s>
<s> Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT </s>
<s> The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H! </s>
