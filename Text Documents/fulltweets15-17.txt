<s> "Stay on message" is the chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents! </s>
<s> I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so! </s>

<s> So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine, they have already taken Crimea and continue to push. That's what I said! </s>
<s> When I said in an interview that Putin is "not going into Ukraine, you can mark it down," I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea! </s>
<s> This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart! </s>
<s> Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice! </s>
<s> Wow, it is unbelievable how distorted, one-sided and biased the media is against us. The failing @nytimes is a joke. @CNN is laughable! </s>
<s> The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why, then, my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H? </s>
<s> I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me! </s>
<s> Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our "leaders" to eradicate it! </s>

<s> #CrookedHillary = Obama's third term, which would be terrible news for our economic growth - seen below.  </s>
<s> Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA? </s>
<s> I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better! </s>

<s> In Hillary Clinton's America - things get worse. #TrumpPence16  </s>

<s> Thank you!   Facebook:   Instagram:   </s>
<s> Crooked Hillary said that I "couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign." Really,I just beat 16 people and am beating her! </s>

<s> Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and "forgot" to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream! </s>
<s> The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. @CNN and the little watched @Morning_Joe = SAD! </s>
<s> No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes. </s>
<s> Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world. </s>
<s> Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety. </s>
<s> Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street! </s>
<s> Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words. </s>
<s> Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country. </s>

<s> Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic </s>
<s> Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to "carpet bomb" the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz! </s>
<s> Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO! </s>
<s> Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough! </s>
<s> The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD! </s>
<s> Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said "Trump is a genius." America 1st! </s>
<s> As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv. </s>
<s> Just like I have warned from the beginning, Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP.   </s>
<s> Many of Bernie's supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep? </s>
<s> I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention! </s>
<s> No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated! </s>

<s> Pocahontas bombed last night! Sad to watch. </s>
<s> Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great </s>
<s> Funny, if you listen to @FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a difference </s>
<s> Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time. </s>
<s> Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated! </s>
<s> Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs. </s>
<s> If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself. </s>
<s> I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air! </s>
<s> Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke! </s>
<s> While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers. </s>
<s> Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War. </s>

<s> The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE! </s>
<s> Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn! </s>
<s> Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance! </s>
<s> Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie. </s>
<s> If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same. </s>
<s> Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  </s>
<s> Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened! </s>
<s> How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie! </s>
<s> The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me </s>
<s> Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing! </s>
<s> The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you! </s>
<s> The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out! </s>
<s> The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well! </s>
<s> Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook! </s>
<s> Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out </s>
<s> If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild </s>
<s> The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN! </s>
<s> I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left! </s>
<s> Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.) </s>
<s> Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD! </s>
<s> There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end! </s>
<s> An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates. </s>
<s> Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite! </s>
<s> Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else! </s>
<s> Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT </s>
<s> The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H! </s>
<s> #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpPence16  </s>
<s> Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart! </s>
<s> The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud! </s>
<s> Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me! </s>
<s> I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs! </s>
<s> Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer! </s>
<s> Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back! </s>
<s> Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA. </s>
<s> Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED </s>
<s> Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her! </s>
<s> Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing! </s>
<s> The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight? </s>
<s> I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam. </s>

<s> Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  </s>
<s> MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  </s>
<s> Why is this reporter touching me as I leave news conference? What is in her hand??  </s>
<s> This was the reporters statement- when she found out there was tape from my facility, she changed her tune.  </s>
<s> Victory press conference was over.  Why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions? Can I press charges?  </s>
<s> Why aren't people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened, that is before she found out the episode was on tape? </s>
<s> Wow, Corey Lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there! </s>
<s> How come the @TODAYshow & @chucktodd show the new @NBCNews Poll for Hillary vs Bernie but do not show the SAME poll where I am killing Cruz? </s>
<s> I have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than Cruz or Kasich, and yet am not being treated properly by the Republican Party or the RNC. </s>
<s> Wow, @CNN has nothing but my opponents on their shows. Really one-sided and unfair reporting. Maybe I shouldn't do their town-hall tonight! </s>
<s> We need to secure our borders ASAP. No games, we must be smart, tough and vigilant. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN & MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN! </s>
<s> Lyin' Ted, I have already beaten you in all debates, and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates. You should focus on jobs & illegal imm! </s>
<s> Lyin'Ted Cruz is weak & losing big, so now he wants to debate again. But, according to Drudge,Time and on-line polls, I have won all debates </s>
<s> After the way I beat Gov. Scott Walker (and Jeb, Rand, Marco and all others) in the Presidential Primaries, no way he would ever endorse me! </s>
<s> Just released that international gangs are all over our cities. This will end when I am President! </s>
<s> Ted Cruz is incensed that I want to refocus NATO on terrorism, as well as current mission, but also want others to PAY FAIR SHARE, a must! </s>
<s> A detainee released from Gitmo has killed an American. When will our so-called "leaders" ever learn! </s>
<s> "Kirsten Powers: Anti- Trump Operative was Aggressively Shopping Cruz Story"  via the Gateway Pundit:  </s>
<s> I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:30. Things are looking good, had a great Easter-look forward to spending the week in Wisconsin! </s>
<s> The United States cannot continue to make such bad, one-sided trade deals. There are only so many jobs we can give up. No more! </s>
<s> See Lyin' Ted, even the @DailyBeast (no fan of mine) says this story came from Rubio, not Trump!  </s>
<s> Just to show you how unfair Republican primary politics can be, I won the State of Louisiana and get less delegates than Cruz-Lawsuit coming </s>
<s> Why can't the pundits be honest? Hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again. I will make it strong and great!  JOBS! </s>
<s> Another radical Islamic attack, this time in Pakistan, targeting Christian women & children. At least 67 dead,400 injured. I alone can solve </s>
<s> Happy Easter to all, have a great day! </s>
<s> My statement on NATO being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive (and unfair) for the U.S. are now, finally, receiving plaudits! </s>

<s> I am interviewed on This Week on @ABC this morning. Enjoy! </s>
<s> Remember, I am the only candidate who is self-funding. While I am given little credit for this by the voters, I am not bought like others! </s>
<s> Don't believe the @FoxNews Polls, they are just another phony hit job on me. I will beat Hillary Clinton easily in the General Election. </s>
<s> Wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in U.S., jobs are leaving. I will make our economy strong again - bring in jobs </s>
<s> Nobody will protect our Nation like Donald J. Trump. Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong. Illegals out! </s>
<s> Lyin' Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enq.were caused by me. I had NOTHING to do with story! </s>
<s> The press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women, when they know that it is just the opposite! </s>
<s> The media is so after me on women  Wow, this is a tough business. Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump! </s>
<s> Top suspect in Paris massacre, Salah Abdeslam, who also knew of the Brussels attack, is no longer talking. Weak leaders, ridiculous laws! </s>
<s> Wow, just released that $67 million in negative ads was spent on me. How am I still number one - by a lot? </s>
<s> I didn't start the fight with Lyin'Ted Cruz over the GQ cover pic of Melania, he did. He knew the PAC was putting it out - hence, Lyin' Ted! </s>
<s> Just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the Trump U case but the press refuses to write about it. If I lost-monster story! </s>
<s> MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  </s>
<s> Endorsements for Lyin' Ted Cruz-  </s>
<s> Europe and the U.S. must immediately stop taking in people from Syria. This will be the destruction of civilization as we know it! So sad! </s>
<s> Just announced that as many as 5000 ISIS fighters have infiltrated Europe. Also, many in U.S.  I TOLD YOU SO! I alone can fix this problem! </s>
<s> Explain how the women on The View, which is a total disaster since the great Barbara Walters left, ever got their jobs. @abc is wasting time </s>
<s> .@TheView T.V. show, which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air, is constantly asking me to go on. I TELL THEM "NO" </s>
<s> Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years. TIME FOR A CHANGE, I WILL SOLVE - AND FAST! </s>
<s> It is amazing how often I am right, only to be criticized by the media. Illegal immigration, take the oil, build the wall, Muslims, NATO! </s>
<s> Remember when I recently said that Brussels is a "hell hole" and a mess and the failing @nytimes wrote a critical article. I was so right! </s>
<s> These politicians like Cruz and Graham, who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years, do nothing to make things better! </s>
<s> .@LindseyGrahamSC and Lyin' Ted Cruz are two politicians who are very much alike - ALL TALK AND NO ACTION! Both talk about ISIS, do nothing! </s>
<s> It is amazing how @LindseyGrahamSC gets on so many T.V. shows talking negatively about me when I beat him so badly (ZERO) in his pres run! </s>
<s> We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of N.A.T.O. Why? It is time to renegotiate, and the time is now! </s>
<s> N.A.T.O. is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on! </s>
<s> MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! </s>
<s> I want to thank @RealSheriffJoe for all of his help in our historic Arizona win. Could not have done it without you Joe! </s>
<s> While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates, it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race! </s>
<s> I think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted. Jeb spent more than $150,000,000 and got nothing. I spent a fraction of that and am first! </s>
<s> I will be the best by far in fighting terror. Im the only one that was right from the beginning, & now Lyin Ted & others are copying me. </s>
<s> Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror. Shes been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are! </s>
<s> Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates, Lyin Ted Cruz. Honestly, I cant blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion! </s>
<s> Lyin Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me, and lines from Michael Douglas just another dishonest politician. </s>
<s> Thank you, Arizona! #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpTrain   </s>
<s> Lyin' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G.Q. model photo post of Melania. That's why we call him Lyin' Ted! </s>
<s> Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November, paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices! </s>
<s> Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona. Thank you, I will never forget! </s>
<s> Thank you, Arizona! #Trump2016 #WesternTuesday #TrumpTrain  </s>
<s> Incompetent Hillary, despite the horrible attack in Brussels today, wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in.  No way! </s>
<s> Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife! </s>
<s> Pres. Obama should leave the baseball game in Cuba immediately & get home to Washington- where a #POTUS, under a serious emergency belongs! </s>

<s> I have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody- and its not even close. Hopefully AZ and UT will be voting for me today! </s>
<s> MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! </s>
<s> President Obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in Cuba, especially in the shadows of Brussels. He is being treated badly! </s>
<s> Do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place Brussels was. Not anymore, it is from a different world! U.S. must be vigilant and smart! </s>
<s> Wow, President Obama just landed in Cuba, a big deal, and Raul Castro wasn't even there to greet him. He greeted Pope and others. No respect </s>
<s> Big Republican Dinner tonight at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach. I will be there! </s>
<s> So the highly overrated anchor, @megynkelly, is allowed to constantly say bad things about me on her show, but I can't fight back? Wrong! </s>
<s> The protesters blocked a major highway yesterday, delaying entry to my RALLY in Arizona by hours, and the media blames my supporters! </s>
<s> Why is it that the horrendous protesters, who scream, curse punch, shut down roads/doors during my RALLIES,  are never blamed by media? SAD! </s>

<s> Do you believe that Hillary Clinton now wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants? She should spend more time taking care of our great Vets! </s>

<s> This was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote. #CruzFraud  </s>
<s> I will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! @FoxNews </s>
<s> Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified. </s>
<s> And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie! </s>
<s> The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud </s>
<s> Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters. </s>
<s> During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz. </s>
<s> Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad! </s>
<s> Great job on @donlemon tonight @kayleighmcenany  @cherijacobus begged us for a job. We said no and she went hostile. A real dummy! @CNN </s>
<s> On my way to New Hampshire- expecting a big and spirited crowd!  #FITN #Trump2016    </s>

<s> I don't believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign, the only one. I will keep doing, but not worth it! </s>
<s> I will be talking about my wonderful experience in Iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media-later in New Hampshire. Big crowd </s>
<s> The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly. Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history! </s>
<s> Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa, I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz & Rubio. Came in a strong second. Great honor </s>

<s> Wow, just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me, will repeal & replace. He lies! </s>
<s> Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans, scam! </s>
