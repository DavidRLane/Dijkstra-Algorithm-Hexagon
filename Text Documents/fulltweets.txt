<s> I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me! </s>
<s> Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our "leaders" to eradicate it! </s>

<s> No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes. </s>
<s> Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world. </s>
<s> Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety. </s>
<s> Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street! </s>
<s> Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words. </s>

<s> Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO! </s>
<s> Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough! </s>
<s> The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD! </s>
<s> Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said "Trump is a genius." America 1st! </s>
<s> As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv. </s>
<s> Just like I have warned from the beginning, Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP.   </s>
<s> Many of Bernie's supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep? </s>
<s> I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention! </s>
<s> No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated! </s>

<s> Pocahontas bombed last night! Sad to watch. </s>
<s> Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great </s>
<s> Funny, if you listen to @FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a difference </s>
<s> Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time. </s>
<s> Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated! </s>
<s> Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs. </s>
<s> If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself. </s>
<s> I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air! </s>
<s> Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke! </s>
<s> While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers. </s>
<s> Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War. </s>

<s> Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn! </s>
<s> Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance! </s>
<s> Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie. </s>
<s> If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same. </s>
<s> Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  </s>
<s> Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened! </s>
<s> How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie! </s>
<s> The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me </s>
<s> Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing! </s>
<s> The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you! </s>
<s> The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out! </s>
<s> The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well! </s>
<s> Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook! </s>
<s> Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out </s>
<s> If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild </s>
<s> The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN! </s>
<s> I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left! </s>
<s> Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.) </s>
<s> Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD! </s>
<s> There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end! </s>
<s> An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates. </s>
<s> Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite! </s>
<s> Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else! </s>
<s> Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT </s>
<s> The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H! </s>
<s> #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpPence16  </s>
<s> Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart! </s>
<s> The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud! </s>
<s> Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me! </s>
<s> I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs! </s>
<s> Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer! </s>
<s> Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back! </s>
<s> Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA. </s>
<s> Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED </s>
<s> Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her! </s>
<s> Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing! </s>
<s> The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight? </s>
<s> I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam. </s>
