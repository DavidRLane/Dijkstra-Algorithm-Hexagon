# Trump-Twitter-Generator

In order to use the Word_Synth.java file, create a java project in Eclipse, or whatever editor you are using, and then put the java files inside your project file. The text files must be put under "User Name" in the user folder under "C://". Run "Word_Synth.java" first; this is the file that will create the hashtables for all of the words to be used later. It will ask if you want to create a new file or not, if you have not run the program before enter "y", or if you would like new words generated based on a new file being used. Once you have generated the files that will be used for the other java file "Main.java", run Main.java and wait for the sentence generator.
